## Modern Gaius Julius Caesar
The main idea to find the flag is to observe keyboard properly.

#### Step-1:
We are given this text `BUH'tdy,|Bim5y~Bdt76yQ`.

Description:
```
One of the easiest and earliest known ciphers but with XXI century twist! Nobody uses 
Alphabet nowadays right? Why should you when you have your keyboard?
```
#### Step-2:
Clearly, first letters of the decrypted message have to be `CTF...`

#### Step-3:
So, I observed the pattern and I got that to decrypt the given message we have to go 2 keys left on a standard QWERTY English Keyboard.

Therefore, `BUH'tdy,|Bim5y~Bdt76yQ` = `CTFlearn{Cyb3r_Cae54r}`

#### Step-4:
Finally, the flag becomes:
`CTFlearn{Cyb3r_Cae54r}`
