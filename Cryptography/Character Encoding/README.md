## Character Encoding
The main idea finding the flag using simple Hex to text conversion.

#### Step-1:
Generally, I don't criticize any challenge, but this one crossed limits. It was too Ez. xP.

We have been given simple Hex code: `41 42 43 54 46 7B 34 35 43 31 31 5F 31 35 5F 55 35 33 46 55 4C 7D`

#### Step-2:
Convert it online here to text:

#### Step-3:

Finally the flag becomes:
`ABCTF{45C11_15_U53FUL}`
